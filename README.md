Carousel of Reviews - a JavaScript Project by Tarek


Welcome to my project for a carousel of reviews! This project is a simple JavaScript web application that displays a carousel of customer reviews. The reviews are pulled from a JSON file and displayed one at a time in a carousel that can be navigated by clicking buttons.


One of the most exciting features of this project is the random review button! This button will randomly select one of the reviews in the carousel and display it in a pop-up window. You can also click the button multiple times to see a completely different review each time.
